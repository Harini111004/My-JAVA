1	Reverse String	Reverses the characters in a string
2	ASCII Value	Displays ASCII value of each character
3	Palindrome Check	Checks if a string is a palindrome
4	Fibonacci Series	Prints Fibonacci numbers up to N terms
5	Vowel & Consonant Counter	Counts vowels and consonants in a string
6	Prime Number Check	Verifies if a number is prime
7	Factorial (Loop)	Calculates factorial using iteration
8	Factorial (Recursion)	Calculates factorial using recursion
9	Swapping Two Numbers	Swaps two integers
10	Odd or Even	Checks if a number is odd or even
